# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **MuData stack is core**: `mudata`, `anndata`, and `scipy` are required dependencies (no longer an optional extra). Use bare `pip install qpx`.
- **`quantify` extra**: now `mokume[directlfq]>=0.1.0` (DirectLFQ via mokume's optional extra).

### Removed

- **`[mudata]` optional extra** — MuData export is included in the default install.
- **`[transforms]` optional extra, with its `biopython` and `mygene` dependencies** — gene mapping now parses FASTA headers directly, so `qpxc transform gene-map` works in a bare install (and in the published container, which never carried the extra).
- **MyGene.info lookup and the `--species` option of `qpxc transform gene-map`** — the transform no longer queries a network service. `gg_names` comes from the FASTA `GN=` field; `gg_accessions` is left as the converter wrote it instead of being overwritten from the API.

### Fixed

- **`gene-map --dataset` copied only top-level files** — sharded / partitioned datasets kept their views in subdirectories, so an annotated copy came back incomplete. Subdirectories are now copied too, and a `--output-folder` that is the dataset itself or nested inside it is rejected instead of copying into its own destination.
- **`gene-map` accepted `--in-place` together with `--output-folder`** — the destination silently won; it is now a usage error.
- **`annotate_dataframe` divided by zero on an empty view** — the mapped-share log now reports 0.0%.

- **Ontology PK uniqueness**: ontology writes collapse to one row per `(field_name, view)` (first-wins) when a field is both a discovered score and a mapped field.
- **DIA-NN blank `anchor_protein`**: empty/whitespace first accession from `Protein.Group` is written as NULL; validators treat blank anchors as unset.

### Added

- **`qpxc transform gene-map --dataset`**: annotate a whole QPX dataset instead of one file. Both quantification views that carry protein accessions (pg and feature) are annotated, identity recipes are preserved so `pg_id`/`feature_id` do not change, and the dataset's MuData view is rebuilt when one is present — so a `.h5mu` never describes stale genes. Writes go through a staging directory, so `--in-place` never truncates a parquet that is still being read.
- **`qpx.mudata.write_dataset_mudata()`**: the converters' best-effort `.h5mu` writer, extracted so transforms that rewrite parquet can refresh the view the same way.
- **QuantMS MSstats converter**: `qpxc convert quantms-msstats` converts a QuantMS-generated `*_msstats_in.csv` plus its authoritative SDRF into QPX Feature, Sample, Run, Dataset, Ontology, and Provenance views. LFQ/TMT/iTRAQ labels are canonicalized, channel rows are collapsed per measured Feature, and unsupported PSM/PG views are not fabricated.
- **Spectronaut converter**: `qpxc convert spectronaut` — full support for Spectronaut report TSV files, producing feature.parquet and pg.parquet with DuckDB-accelerated batch processing
- **CPTAC CDAP converter**: `qpxc convert cdap` — convert CPTAC CDAP `.psm` study directories to QPX psm/feature/pg/dataset/ontology/provenance views
- **Full-spectra mz converter**: `qpxc convert mz` — convert a directory of mzML / `.mzML.gz` files to a single `mz.parquet`; each spectrum carries `run_file_name` + `scan` for linking back to PSM/feature
- **pdc2qpx pipeline**: `qpxc pdc2qpx` — one-shot PDC/CPTAC download (via pridepy, `qpx[pdc]` extra) + CDAP + full-spectra conversion into an entire QPX dataset
- **Shared channel-label resolution**: `qpx/converters/channel_labels.py` — single source for canonical TMT/iTRAQ/LFQ labels via sdrf-pipelines `channel_map`, used by the OpenMS `consensusXML` and `-out_qpx` paths
- **openms-consensus interim protein intensity**: the `openms-consensus` converter now fills `pg.intensity` with an interim, **unnormalized sum of each group's unique peptides** per `(protein group, grouped_runs, label)` (the quantms `unique_peptides` policy) instead of leaving it null, until OpenMS `-out_qpx` ships the authoritative quant. Every quantified row is stamped with a `quantification_method` cv_param; `--pg-top N` bounds the peptides used (`0` = all; `3` mirrors the ProteomicsLFQ/IsobaricWorkflow default)
- **openms-consensus channel/SDRF consistency check**: when an SDRF is provided, the converter compares the isobaric channels read from the consensusXML maps against the SDRF `comment[label]` set and logs a warning for any channel present in one but not the other (e.g. a mis-declared plex or the wrong SDRF)
- **Mandatory identity ids**: the `feature`, `psm` and `pg` views each carry a single required `int64` identity column — `feature_id` / `psm_id` / `pg_id` — that is the primary key of the view. The id is derived by the writer as an opaque hash of a footer-declared `identity_composite` of existing columns (feature `[peptidoform, charge, run_file_name, rt]`, psm `[peptidoform, charge, run_file_name, scan]`, pg `[anchor_protein, grouped_runs, label]`), or accepted under the view's producer-ID rule. Each file self-describes its `primary_key` + `identity_composite` in the footer, and primary-key uniqueness validation catches any hash collision. See bigbio/qpx#229.
- **Cross-view reference columns (optional)**: `feature.psm_ids` (`list<int64>`), `feature.pg_ids` (`list<int64>`) and `psm.feature_id` (`int64`, nullable) let the views reference each other by id (feature ↔ PSM ↔ protein group); populated where a converter can resolve the mapping, null otherwise
- **Writer identity enforcement**: `FeatureWriter` re-derives identified Feature ids by default, stashing an overridden producer id as a `provided_feature_id` cv_param. Unidentified Features without a producer id may derive one from the declared composite only when the resulting full-file primary key is unique; successful fallback is reported as a warning. Producer ids are namespaced by run. Existing-file transformations can preserve the stored id and its footer-declared composite. Identity-bearing writers validate the complete output file on close and raise on null or duplicate primary keys.
- **MuData (`.h5mu`) export**: OpenMS (`-out_qpx`), `openms-consensus`, and DIA-NN conversions now also emit a `<prefix>.h5mu` MuData container (`qpx/mudata.py` + `orchestrator._write_mudata`), giving parity with quantmsdiann. It bundles up to four modalities — `precursors` (peptidoform×charge feature intensities), `proteins` (protein-group intensities), `expression` (Absolute Expression), `differential` (Differential Expression) — plus a `varp["feature_mapping"]` precursor↔protein adjacency. See the MuData section of the serialization spec
- **De-novo / no-database-search support**: features and PSMs from de-novo or search-free workflows (no protein mapping, no target-decoy) are now accepted

### Changed

- **Feature/PSM/PG primary key is now the derived id** (`feature_id` / `psm_id` / `pg_id`) instead of the composite tuple; the previous composite is retained as the footer-declared `identity_composite` the id is derived from
- **Deterministic ids across write paths**: the id is now derived from the **persisted (Arrow-cast) values** in a single place, so `write_batch`, `write_table`, and `write_dataframe` produce identical ids for the same row (previously a float32 field such as `rt` could hash differently on the record vs table path). The `write_table`/`write_dataframe` paths derive the id before the non-nullable cast, so a frame/table without a precomputed id is accepted
- **Injective identity encoding**: `canonical()` uses JSON (quoted/escaped) instead of a delimiter join, so composites whose list elements or fields contain the delimiters (e.g. run names with commas) can no longer alias to the same id. Ordered list fields such as multi-component `scan` identifiers retain their order; only set-valued `grouped_runs` is canonicalized without regard to order
- **Referential validation** also flags reciprocal feature↔psm desync (an edge present one way but contradicted by the other), as a warning, only where the opposite direction is populated
- **OpenMS consensus identity** retains every spectrum reference associated with a run and the parent `consensus_rt`, preventing distinct ConsensusFeatures from collapsing onto the same derived `feature_id`
- **BREAKING — pg view flattened**: the `pg` view changes from one row per `(anchor_protein, grouped_runs)` carrying a nested `intensities: list<{label, intensity}>` column to **one row per label** with scalar `label` + `intensity` columns (identification-only groups become a single row with null `label`/`intensity`). Converters still build the natural per-group `intensities` list; the writer materializes the flat layout. Regenerate pg files
- **De-novo relaxation**: `feature.is_decoy`, `feature.anchor_protein`, and `psm.is_decoy` are now **nullable** (previously required) so de-novo / no-inference records are representable — consumers must no longer assume these are non-null
- **BREAKING — Feature/PSM identity composites** (format 1.1, issue #217): the
  schema-default Feature composite changes from `[sequence, charge,
  run_file_name, anchor_protein]` to `[peptidoform, charge, run_file_name, rt]`;
  the PSM composite changes from `[sequence, charge, run_file_name, scan]` to
  `[peptidoform, charge, run_file_name, scan]`. Measured across ~13M real rows,
  `anchor_protein` is functionally redundant and apex `rt` distinguishes
  repeated peaks where the producer reports it. A converter may declare a
  different producer-specific Feature composite when its upstream entity uses
  other measured properties. The actual primary keys are the mandatory opaque
  ID columns described above. Regenerate Feature and PSM files.
- **Parquet output size**: writers now apply `BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT` encoding to high-entropy float columns (rt, rt_start/stop, predicted_rt, calculated/observed m/z, intensity arrays) and raise the ZSTD level to 9. Encoding-only and fully lossless — no schema change; output reads unchanged with pyarrow and DuckDB. Measured ~16% smaller on a 14 GB feature.parquet.

### Removed

- **BREAKING — QuantMS/mzTab converter**: removed `qpxc convert quantms`, `QuantMSConverter`, its adapters, and the mzTab+MSstats loader. Use `qpxc convert openms-consensus` (consensusXML) — see the deprecation of `qpxc convert openms` below.

### Deprecated

- **`qpxc convert openms` (the OpenMS `-out_qpx` parquet path)**: deprecated in favour of `qpxc convert openms-consensus`. OpenMS `-out_qpx` mis-assigns **every** PSM's `run_file_name` to the first run (the per-PSM `map_index` is dropped; OpenMS#9872) and emits duplicate PSMs (one feature-attached + one unassigned; OpenMS#9871) — so on any multi-run / multi-fraction / multi-replicate design ~half the PSMs carry the wrong run. `qpxc convert openms-consensus` reads the consensusXML directly and resolves the correct run per PSM (via `map_index`/`id_merge_index`/feature-element runs), so it does not have these defects. The `openms` command now emits a deprecation warning; it will be reconsidered once OpenMS ships an `-out_qpx` that carries the correct per-PSM run.

### Fixed

- **DIA-NN q-value handling — feature/pg consistency, filtering is opt-in** (bigbio/qpx#241): the DIA-NN feature and pg views are now consistent and **neither filters by default**. `--qvalue-threshold` is opt-in (default unset): with no threshold the converter emits every feature and protein group the report contains, since DIA-NN already FDR-filters its main report and all per-row q-value columns (feature: `Q.Value`, `Global.Q.Value`, `PEP`, `Lib.Q.Value`, `Translated.Q.Value`; pg: `PG.Q.Value`, `Global.PG.Q.Value`, `Protein.Q.Value`, `Lib.PG.Q.Value`, `GG.Q.Value`) are carried through unconditionally for downstream filtering at any level. This resolves the earlier feature/pg inconsistency and count inflation by making both views as-reported rather than by forcing a pg filter. When `--qvalue-threshold` **is** given, each view filters at its own level — the feature view on precursor `Q.Value` and the pg view on `Global.PG.Q.Value` (falling back to `PG.Q.Value`). The Spectronaut converter's `--qvalue-threshold` is likewise opt-in.
- **DIA-NN empty channel columns**: reports whose `Channel`/`Label` column is entirely empty are treated as label-free, while partially missing multiplex channel identifiers remain invalid.
- **FragPipe Feature PSM enrichment**: `experiment_annotation.tsv`, explicit experiment mappings, or SDRF mappings now resolve each experiment to its exact raw run before attaching PSM metadata; multi-run experiments are left unenriched instead of borrowing one fraction's PSM.
- **Deterministic DIA-NN merged-group PG quantity**: when annotation noise merges protein-group rows that disagree on `PG.Quantity` / `PG.MaxLFQ`, the pg view now emits the max of the finite values (order-independent) instead of a row-order-dependent "first", and warns when the values actually disagree.
- **DIA-NN `observed_mz` NULL instead of 0.0 sentinel** (bigbio/qpx#244): a feature with no `Precursor.Mz` and no `ms_info` source now carries a truthful `NULL` observed m/z rather than a `0.0` that corrupts downstream mass-error / PPM math; report runs with no matching `*_ms_info.parquet` are warned about before being dropped.
- **Controlled unidentified Feature identity fallback**: an unidentified Feature (null `peptidoform`) with no producer id derives a candidate `feature_id` from the declared composite. The fallback is accepted with a warning only after full-file primary-key uniqueness succeeds; a collision remains a hard error. A producer-supplied id remains namespaced by run and preserved as a `provided_feature_id` cv_param.
- **openms-consensus isobaric detection**: real quantms `IsobaricWorkflow` output stamps TMT/iTRAQ consensusXML with `experiment_type="label-free"` while the maps still carry `tmt6plex_*`/`itraq*plex_*` labels. The converter now detects channels from the **map label** (not `experiment_type`), so real quantms TMT no longer collapses all reporter channels into a single `LFQ` label. Verified on real cluster output (PXD000001 TMT → TMT126–131; BSA/PXD002395 LFQ unchanged)
- **RT unit conversion**: DIA-NN and MaxQuant converters now correctly convert retention time from minutes to seconds in feature and PSM parquet output
- **Code quality**: Spectronaut converter refactored to reduce cyclomatic complexity, fix logging f-string interpolation, remove unused arguments, and eliminate duplicate code
- **CDAP label-free intensity label**: label-free `PrecursorArea` intensities are now emitted with the `"LFQ"` label (aligned with the FragPipe/MaxQuant converters) so downstream label-free consumers (mokume) recognize them as primary intensities
- **QPX TMT/iTRAQ channel labels**: OpenMS `-out_qpx` enrichment relabels feature/pg intensities from filenames/bare indices to plex-aware canonical reporter names; `run.samples[].label` is normalized to match — all from the shared sdrf-pipelines `channel_map` vocabulary
